# Onboarding

Welcome to the lab!

Here are some steps to get setup to get started:

if you don't already have one, create accounts on:
- Overleaf
- GitHub
- Create a repo [from this GitHub classroom assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/CmTBip2m).

_if you're not actually joining the lab yet, you can view the [template](https://github.com/ml4sts/research-mentoring)_
