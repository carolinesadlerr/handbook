# Reading Research

Reading research papers is an essential skill in research. To learn this
 skill, start with reading [How to Read a Paper](../resources/keshav_howtoread.pdf)
 which describes a framework for effectively reading complex papers.

## Reference Management

While you are reading, you will accumulate a lot of papers.  It is best to
keep track of them using a a reference manager, for example [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).  
. Create an account and [request to join the lab's group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2869556/ml4sts). As you add papers to your library, add them to the appropriate projects group as well to share them with co-authors.

```{tip}
Set up  [google scholar to use the URI library](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings?oi=gsb&hl=en#2) so that you'll get better links to accessing paywalled papers
```

We write papers using LaTeX, which uses BibTeX for writing bibliographies, so
maintaining your read papers in BibTeX will make it easier when you start
preparing papers. Zotero can output a BibTeX and it can be imported directly to Overleaf. I also recommend the [better BibTeX extension](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/) and [setting the citation keys](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/#set-your-own-fixed-citation-keys) to be `lastnameYYYYfirstword`.

Ways to get the BibTeX entry for a paper
  - from Google Scholar, click the cite button, then choose BibTeX.
  - add to a reference management software and fill in fields
  - follow the [BibTeX standard](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) and write it manually
