# LaTeX Tips


Use the [`todonotes`](http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/todonotes/todonotes.pdf) package for margin notes.

Link to your Zotero after you've joined the shared shared group to get the imported library into your paper. See more about [referencing](reading:references).  

Tables are generally best maintained in a .csv and then converted, for example with this [Spread-LaTeX Chrome extension](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/spreadlatex/218144906748).
